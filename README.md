## üöÄ Contributing

We welcome contributions to Ultimate Multisite! Here's how you can contribute effectively:

### Development Workflow

1. **Quick Setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/superdav42/wp-multisite-waas.git
   cd wp-multisite-waas
   npm run dev:setup  # Installs dependencies and sets up Git hooks
   ```

2. **Development Commands:**
   ```bash
   npm test              # Run tests
   npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
   npm run lint         # Check code style (PHPCS)
   npm run lint:fix     # Fix code style automatically
   npm run stan         # Run static analysis (PHPStan)
   npm run quality      # Run lint + stan
   npm run check        # Run all quality checks
   npm run build        # Production build
   npm run build:dev    # Development build
   npm run clean        # Clean build artifacts
   ```

3. **Making Changes:**
   - Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
   - Make your changes with tests
   - Git hooks will automatically run PHPCS and PHPStan on changed files
   - Commit using conventional format: `feat(scope): description`
   - Run `npm run check` before pushing
   - Push and create a Pull Request

4. **Code Quality:**
   - Pre-commit hooks run automatically
   - Follow WordPress coding standards
   - Include tests for new features
   - Maintain >80% code coverage
   - Use conventional commit messages

5. **Important:** Update both README.md and readme.txt files when making changes that affect versions, features, or documentation.

### Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting pull requests, please:

1. Include a clear description of the changes and their purpose
2. Reference any related issues using GitHub's issue linking syntax (#123)
3. Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions
4. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes if applicable
5. Make sure all tests pass (if available)
6. Update documentation as needed
7. Verify that both README.md and readme.txt are updated and synchronized

### Release Process

Releases are automated using GitHub Actions workflows that trigger when a version tag is pushed.

**Tagging Convention:** To trigger a new release build, push a tag following the semantic versioning format:

```bash
git tag v2.3.5  # For example, for version 2.3.5
git push origin v2.3.5
```

The tag must begin with "v" followed by the version number (v*.*.\*)

This will automatically:

1. Build the plugin (run `npm run build`)
2. Create a properly packaged ZIP file
3. Create a GitHub release with the ZIP attached

When preparing for a release:

1. Update the version number in the main plugin file and readme.txt
2. Update the changelog in readme.txt
3. Ensure README.md and readme.txt are synchronized with the latest information
4. Create and push the appropriate version tag
